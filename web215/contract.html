            I, <a class="bio" href="introduction.html">Patrick L. Jeffers</a> agree to abide by the terms in my Spring Web215-N801 Web Markup and Scripting course with professor D.I. von Briesen.
            </p>
            <p>
            I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            </p>
            <p>
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absence.
            </p>
            <p>
