                    <strong>Personal Background:</strong> I'm 32 and have lived in the Charlotte area for almost all of it. I'm a man of 1000 hobbies and hope to make programming a new career path for me or at least hobby 1001.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Professional Background:</strong> I have primarily spent my career as an automotive technician.  I still work full time in this role, diagnosing and repairing various drivability concerns as well as advising and completing maintenance for our customers.
                <li>
                    <strong>Academic Background: </strong> I graduated high school in 2007. Immediately following that I enrolled at CPCC in an automotive program supported by BMW. I received an AA in Transport Systems Technologies after completing that program.
                    I've recently decided to change careers and am now working towards an AA in Full stack Programming.

                <li>
                    <strong>Background in this subject: </strong> So far my background is WEB110 and WEB115.  I have taken several other courses in the computer science field but that is all for WEB so far.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> I grew up with Windows machines but have mainly used Mac since 2010. I now use both depending on the needs and situation but I much prefer MAC OS overall.  Surface Pro 6 / Macbook Pro.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Courses I'm Taking, &amp; Why:</strong>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>
                            <a class="bio" href="contract.html">WEB215 - Advanced Markup and Scripting - </a> Required for my degree.
                        </li>

                        CSC221 - Advanced Python Programming - Required for my degree.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Funny/Interesting item about yourself:</strong> I'm a bit of a motor sports junkie. I love riding motorcycles, go karts, and I have a racecar that Iâ€™ve spent years building and enjoy driving at various events.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>I'd Also Like To Share:</strong> I'm hoping this new career path will open some opportunities for me in the future. The ability to work more remotely and allow some flexibility to travel more sounds really appealing.
