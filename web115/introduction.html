    <ul>
    	  <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong>  I'm 32 and have lived in the Charlotte area for almost all of it. I'm a man of 1000 hobbies and hope to make programming a new career path for me or at least hobby 1001.</li>
    	  <li><strong>Academic Background: </strong>  I graduated high school in 2007.  Immediately following that I enrolled at CPCC in an automotive program supported by BMW.  I received an AA in Transport Systems Technologies after completing that program.  I've recently decided to change careers and am now working towards an AA in Full stack Programming.</li>
     	  <li><strong>Background in this subject: </strong>  So far the only relevant background in this subject is my prior WEB110 class.  I have taken several other courses in the computer science field but that is all for WEB so far.</li>
    	  <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>  I grew up with Windows machines but have mainly used Mac since 2010.  I now use both depending on the needs and situation but I much prefer MAC OS overall.</li>
    	  <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking, &amp; Why:</strong>
          <ol type="i">
            <li><a href="contract.html">WEB115 - Web Markup and Scripting - </a> This course is required for my degree, but it's always good to learn new skills.</li>
      	    <li>CSC121 - Python Programming - This course is required for my degree.</li>
    	    </ol></li>
    	  <li><strong>Funny/Interesting item about yourself:</strong>  I'm a bit of a motor sports junkie. I love riding motorcycles, go karts, and I have a racecar that Iâ€™ve spent years building and enjoy driving at various events.</li>
    	  <li><strong>I'd Also Like To Share:</strong>  I'm hoping this new career path will open some opportunities for me in the future. The ability to work more remotely and allow some flexibility to travel more sounds really appealing.</li>
